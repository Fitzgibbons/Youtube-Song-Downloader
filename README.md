# Youtube-Song-Downloader
Python script for downloading youtube songs with no more than the name

Requires youtube-dl (Download with "pip3 youtube-dl")

## Usage
Just run the script with the first option being the name of a folder you would like your songs stored in (if the folder doesn't exist it will be created) and the second argument being the name of a plaintext file (txt, csv, etc.). This file should consist of one song name per line and any clarification terms after a semicolon. For example "forever" is a valid line, but if you want to make sure you get the one with all those rappers, you may want to say "forever;eminem lil wayne".

## Disclaimer
Songs will be downloaded from youtube's autogenerated topic channels, so if you use this tool, you may be violating some copyrights. Thus, I take no responsibility and you should only use this under "fair use" or some other legal exception like that, as everything on the internet is **always** done.
